# Fluent Python — Study Notes

![Cover](/assets/cover.jpg)

Short, personal study repository for learning Python from "Fluent Python". Use the cover image located in the assets folder above. If the file name differs, update the image path to point to the actual image file (for example `./assets/cover.png`).

## About
This repo contains chapter-by-chapter notes, examples, exercises, and small projects while working through "Fluent Python". Notes are kept concise, focused on understanding idiomatic Python and practical patterns.

## Goals
- Read and summarize each chapter.
- Implement short examples and exercises.
- Build small projects that apply idioms from the book.
- Track progress and open questions.

## Repository layout
- README.md — this file
- assets/ — cover image and other media
- notes/ — chapter notes (one file per chapter)
- examples/ — small runnable snippets and experiments
- projects/ — short projects applying learned concepts

Suggested notes filenames:
- notes/ch01-intro.md
- notes/ch02-data-model.md
- notes/ch03-functions.md
- ...

## Study plan (suggested)
- Week 1: Chapters 1–3 — fundamentals and data model
- Week 2: Chapters 4–7 — sequences, iterators, generators
- Week 3: Chapters 8–11 — mappings, objects, attributes
- Continue batching 2–3 chapters/week depending on difficulty

## Chapter tracker (example)
| Chapter | Status | Notes |
